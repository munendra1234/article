          <p>Welcome to the new module of <b>“Recursion”. </b>
            We hope that you are enjoying your coding journey. As you have successfully reached Recursion, you should know that it is a wonderful programming tool. It provides a simple, powerful way of approaching a variety of problems. 
            In this article we’ll go over the basics of recursion and hopefully help you develop, or refine, a very important programming skill.

            <div class="content">
              <p><b>What is recursion? 
              </b></p>
              <!-- <p><b>Directed Graph: </b></p> -->
              <p>A function is said to be recursive if it calls itself. 
              </p>
              <!-- <div class="img"><img class="articleImages" name="introduction_to_graphs_and_its_represtation_3.png" alt="img" /></div> -->
                <p>Before we jump into the depth of recursion, let’s try to see some connection between <b>Math</b> and <b>Programming:</b>
                </p>
                <div class="sub-heading-2">Functions: </div>
                <ol>
                  <li>Assume that in Math, there is a function, f(x) = x^2. We can also write a code for this function using Programming.
                  </li>
                  <p>Fun(int x){
                    return x*x;
                  </p>
                  <li>In math, we use this function by substituting value for x,
                  </li>
                  <p>  e.g.  f(2) = 2^2
                    = 2*2
                    =4</p>
                    
                </ol>
                <p>Incidentally, we use a similar approach in programming. We can call the function in main for x = 2 as: int x = Fun(2). 
                </p>
                <p>What we basically want you to explain is that both the methods are quite similar. And functions are just a way to express algebra in programming.
                </p>
                <div class="sub-heading-2">PMI: Principle of Mathematical Induction</div>
                <div class="content">
               <p> I think it’s been a while since you last studied this concept. Let’s sneak into it quickly.
              </p>
                <p>In this, we were given a formula and our aim was to prove the given formula.
                </p>           
                <div class="img"><img class="articleImages" name="print_decreasing_1.png" alt="img" /></div>
                <div class="sub-heading-2">Steps followed to prove the formula are as follow:
                </div>
                <ul>
                  <li>Check whether the formula is true for n = 1, i.e., P(1) is true.
                  </li>
                  <li>If true, then we assume that the formula is true for n = k.
                  </li>
                  <li>Then we need to prove that the formula is also true for n = k + 1.
                  </li>                 
                </ul>
                <div class="img"><img class="articleImages" name="print_decreasing_2.png" alt="img" /></div>
                <p>I hope that you understand this PMI problem. It is important to note that we use similar steps to approach a recursion problem. We will discuss these steps through our problem, “Print Decreasing”.
                </p>
                <p>Taking an example, let us say that we pass 5 as input then we need to print:(5   4   3   2   1) in different lines.
 
                </p>
                <p>Recursion has two stages, High level thinking and Low level thinking.
                </p>
                <div class="img"><img class="articleImages" name="print_decreasing_3.png" alt="img" /></div>
                <!-- <div class="img"><img class="articleImages" name="introduction_to_graphs_and_its_represtation_6.png" alt="img" /></div> -->
              <!-- <div class='editorialCode'> -->
                <P>High level thinking has three parts: 

                </P>
                <u>
                  <li>Expectation
                  </li>
                  <li>Faith 
                  </li>
                  <li>How to meet Expectation with Faith
                  </li>
                </u>

                <p>With high level thinking, we can figure out our basic code.
                  Then coming to low level thinking, we need to dry run our code and try to look at the stack frame after each recursive call. This helps us to identify our base case.
                  

                </p>
                <!-- <div class="img"><img class="articleImages" name="introduction_to_graphs_and_its_represtation_7.png" alt="img" /></div> -->
                <p>And with both high and low level thinking, we will finally get our code. 


                </p>
                <p>Continuing with our example, for n = 5, let's define our expectation and faith.

                </p>
                <div class="img"><img class="articleImages" name="print_decreasing_4.png" alt="img" /></div>
               <ol>
                 <li>Expectation: Our expectation from PrintDecreasing(n) is that if we pass n = 5, it will give us desired output: (5	4	3 	2	1)
                </li>
                 <li>Faith: Our faith from PrintDecreasing(n-1) i.e. PrintDecreasing(4) in this case, is that it will print (4        3        2        1) for sure.
                </li>
                 
               </ol>
               
                <!-- <p>As you can see, the direction of the parallel edges can be the same or opposite. Both are called parallel edges.</p> -->
                <p>At this point you may raise an objection that, How can we assume anything like that? But my friend, have FAITH in you, in us and in PrintDecreasing(4).
                </p>

                <p><b>To meet this expectation with faith, what can we do? 
                </b>
                </p>
                <p>Well, if you look at the expected output of  PrintDecreasing(5) i.e. (5        4        3        2      1) and at PrintIDecreasing(4) i.e. (4        3        2        1) then it can be observed that there is just the difference of 5. So, we can print “5” and then call PrintDecreasing(4), which will print (1        2        3        4) , which seems to give us our output.
               <br> PrintDecreasing(5) {
                Print(5)
                PrintDecreasing(4)      }
                </p>
                <!-- <div class="img"><img class="articleImages" name="introduction_to_graphs_and_its_represtation_10.png" alt="img" /></div> -->
                <p><b>int [] marks; </b>this is the declaration of array
                </p>

                <p>Let’s generalize it for n, PrintDecreasing(n) is a function which is required to print counting from n to 1. We believe that PrintDecreasing(n-1) will print counting from n-1 to 1. Therefore, we first print n and then call PrinDencreasing(n-1), which prints the rest of the counting.
                <br>PrintDecreasing(n) {                                                                                                                               
                  Print(n)
                  PrintDecreasing (n-1)         }
                </p>
                <div class="img"><img class="articleImages" name="print_decreasing_5.png" alt="img" /></div>

                
                <p>Let's code this part for now:

                </p>
                <div class="img"><img class="articleImages" name="print_decreasing_6.png" alt="img" /></div>
              
                <p>Now, as we are done with the <b>High Level Thinking</b> part i.e. with the basic code. Moving to the <b>Low  level Thinking,</b> lets dry run the basic code and find out the base case. 

                </p>
              </div>
                <div class="sub-heading-2">Let’s look into the stack frame:
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                <ul>
                  <li>As shown in the figure, initially, the first call is received from main, all the statements of main before calling PrintDecreasing(5), get executed. 
                  </li>
                  <li>When PrintDecreasing(5) is called, it is pushed to the top of the stack. Then the first statement of this function gets executed which prints “5”further calling PrintDecreasing(4).
                  </li>
                  <li>PrintDecreasing(4),  which then gets pushed on the top of the stack. First statement of this function gets executed which prints “4”, further calling PrintDecreasing(3) which then gets pushed on the top of the stack. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Similarly, this process continues till PrintDecreasing(0), where the first statement gets executed printing “0”, until we realize that we don’t even need to print ‘0’. Also, this code will give us stack overflow, as the function call will keep calling itself with a decremented value. </li>
                  <li>Now knowing this error, we can successfully build our base case. Which will be, whenever, the value of n becomes 0 then we can simply return the function before letting it make further calls.
                  </li>
                  <li>We need to add this statement at the top of the function, before any other statement (recursive call) gets executed.

                <p>Now the last thing that’s left is, how to access these array elements. It is very easy.

                <p>If you want to access the third array element i.e. 96 from this array, we’ll simply write : int a = <b>marks[ 2 ].</b> Now, the variable a contains 96.
