            <p>Welcome Back Readers! </p>
            <p>We hope that you understood the last problem which was <b>Has Path.</b>>
              Moving further, in this article we will discuss about the next problem based on the Graph i.e.<b>Find all Paths in a Graph.</b>>
               </b> </p><br>
            <p>Prerequisite for this problem is the previous problem of this module; Has Path. In case you have not gone through that problem, I suggest that you solve and understand that first.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>So, talking of Find all Paths, we get a hint from its name that we need to find all possible paths between 2 given vertices of the graph.

            </p>
            <p>How is it different from the Has Path problem?

            </p>
            <p>In Has Path, we just check whether there exists a path between two given vertices, but in this problem we need to find and print all possible paths between two given vertices. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Before you move any further, it is advised that you give this problem a fair try.</p>
             <p>let's jump to the problem.
              </p>
            <p><b>Important Links :</b> <a href="https://www.pepcoding.com/resources/online-java-foundation/graphs/print-all-paths-official/ojquestion">Problem Link</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/DrQ-eTN2v3A" target="_blank">Question Video</a> , <a href="https://youtu.be/DrQ-eTN2v3A" target="_blank">Solution Video</a> </p>
            <div class="content">
              <p>Understanding the problem:
              </p>
              <p>In this problem you are given a graph, a source vertex and a destination vertex.

              </p>
              <p>
                <b>All you have to do is find and print all paths between source and destination. Print them in lexicographical order.
                </b>>
              </p>
              <p>Input is managed for you.
             </p>
              <p>Study the example below for better understanding.
              </p>
              <div class="img"><img class="articleImages" name="print_all_path_1.png" alt="img" /></div>
              <p>In the above example, for the given graph, source being 0 and destination being 6, there are 4 possible paths.

              <p>The problem here deals with finding and printing all possible paths between a given source vertex and destination vertex in a graph. To solve this problem we will use Recursion just like previous problems.
              </p>
              <p>Let’s first take a look at hasPath function code:
              </p>
              <div class='codeEditor' id=>
                <div class='editorialCode'>
                  public static boolean hasPath(ArrayList< Edge>[] graph, int src, int dest, boolean[] visited){
                    if (src == dest)                         //1
                       return true;
                  
                    visited[src] = true;                     //2
                    for (Edge e : graph[src]) {              //3
                       if (!visited[e.nbr]) {                //4   
                          boolean nbrHasPath = hasPath(graph, e.nbr, dest, visited);        //5
                          if (nbrHasPath)                                                   //6 
                             return true;                                                   //7
                       }
                    }
                    return false;                                                           //8
              }
              
              
              </div>
              <pre class='output'>
              </pre>
              <span type='text' class='language' style='width:40%;margin-right:5%'>java</span>;
              <span type='text' style='width:40%' class='canRunCode' name='canRunCode'>true</span>";
             </div>


              <ul>
              <li>In the hasPath() function, the return type is Boolean, which basically indicates whether there exists a path between source and destination.

              </li>
              <li>But in this problem, instead of checking and returning some Boolean value we need to print the existing path. 
 
            </li>
                <li>And to achieve this, the first change that we make in printAllPaths() function is that we change the return type of this function to void. 


                </li>
                <li>And in addition, we add String in the argument of the function which will store the path covered so far.

                </li>
                <li>Changing this return type to void also implies that printAllPaths() function returns nothing therefore it makes no sense to capture the result of its recursive calls. (Statement - 5 in above code).

                </li>
                <li>Which also implies the invalidation of statements 6 and 7 from above code for printAllPaths() function.
 
                </li>
                <li>Moving to the most important point; even after doing the above changes, we may get a path or few printed but what about all possible paths.

                </li>
                  <li>To take care of this, it is really important that we explore all possibilities.
                  </li>
                    <li>In the hasPath() function we used to set the corresponding value to src in the visited array as true, so that we can stop the redundant calls.

                    </li>
                    <li>But now, to print all paths, we need to allow even the once visited vertex to contribute to other possible paths. For this, it’s important to set the value, corresponding to src, in the visited array as false, after we explore all possibilities through the src vertex.
                    </li>
                    <!-- <li>As src will make recursive calls to each of its neighbors, suppose that it made the first call to its neighbor 1, nbr1. So now this nbr1 will further make calls to each of its neighbors. 
                    </li>
                    <li>And not to forget, src is also one of nbr1’s neighbors. So src will again make a recursive call to its neighbor and first of all nbr1 will be called.</li>
                    <li>And it will give us a run time error of stack overflow.
                    </li>
                    <li>So, to handle this situation, we make use of the Boolean array, visited, which is already present in the signature of the hasPath() function in the code editor.
                    </li>
                    <li>Every time we enter the hasPath() function corresponding to a certain src, we update the visited array’s src index value to true. 
                    </li>
                    <li>And before making a call for any neighbor, we first check for the corresponding value of this neighbor's visited array.
                    </li>
                    <li>And make a call only if it’s false. As it implies that this vertex is being visited for the first time. </li> -->
